# Madrid pollution 2023

This project aims to demonstrate some useful techniques of data processing and analysis to derive trends at quarter level of neighborhoods of a city out of individual sensor data spread throughout the city. The most important tools used include interpolation, vectorial datacube aggregation, and trend time series analysis.

In this case, a Madrid pollution dataset was used (available at the [Madrid Open Data portal](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob)). The dataset is initially provided in a wide format and provides information for multiple pollutants across 2023.

The complete workflow of the project can be accessed at the `Processing-and-Analysis.md` file in this repository.
